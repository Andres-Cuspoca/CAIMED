A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g. contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of nonautoimmune conditions (e.g. delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted.
 -As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab, drugs with a predisposition to hepatotoxicity should be used with caution in patients treated with nivolumab-containing regimen.
 -Patients should be excluded if they have a positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBVsAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating acute or chronic infection
 -Patients should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
 -History of allergy to study drug components
 -History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody
 -Any other serious illness or medical condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator, make this protocol unreasonably hazardous, including but not limited to:
 1.Any uncontrolled major infection
 2.Cardiac failure NYHA (New York Heart Association) III or IV
 3.Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis
 4.Bone marrow dysplasia
 5.Known allergy to any of the compounds under investigation
 6.Unmanageable fecal incontinence
 -Poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 6 months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, extensive interstitial bilateral lung disease, or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent."
